Develop an MVP/prototype of Insmile AI, an AI-powered dental treatment planning system designed to assist clinics and independent dentists in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient management. The MVP should be fully functional, web-based, and allow seamless interaction between clinics, dentists, and AI-driven diagnostic tools. The design should be modern, clean, intuitive, and optimized for efficiency to demonstrate real-world usability to potential clients, investors, and stakeholders.

Core Functionalities for MVP
1. User Roles & Authentication
Admin (Clinic Owners & Staff)
Manage clinic-wide patient records.
Upload & review AI-generated treatment plans.
Access billing & usage analytics.
Dentists
Upload patient scans (CBCT/X-ray images).
Receive AI-powered diagnosis & treatment recommendations.
Track treatment progress.
Patients (View-Only Portal - Future Expansion)
View assigned treatment plans & progress updates.
✅ Authentication System:

Secure login & registration via email & OTP authentication.
Role-based access control (Admin, Dentist, Patient).
Session management & logout functionality.
2. AI-Powered Treatment Planning & Diagnostics
File Upload System: Allow dentists to upload CBCT scans, X-rays, and radiographs (JPG, PNG, DICOM).
AI Analysis Pipeline:
Pass scans through AI for automatic diagnostics (cavities, misalignments, fractures).
Generate treatment recommendations (e.g., orthodontic plan, implants).
Provide confidence scores on AI results.
Token-Based AI Usage (Demo Purpose)
Display the token usage per scan (e.g., "This scan used 100K tokens").
Allow users to track remaining tokens.
✅ Backend Integration:

Use Azure OpenAI API for diagnostic analysis.
Store scan data in Azure Blob Storage.
Process scans via server-side Python API (Flask/FastAPI).
3. Patient Management & Treatment Tracking
Unique Patient Identifiers (UPI):
Every patient gets a unique ID for tracking treatments across visits.
Treatment Timeline & Reports:
Auto-generate treatment timelines from AI recommendations.
Exportable PDF reports summarizing diagnostics & next steps.
✅ Database Structure:

Use PostgreSQL or Firebase for secure data storage.
Store encrypted patient data for HIPAA compliance.
4. Dashboard & UI/UX Design
Modern, intuitive dashboard with key metrics:
Pending scans, token usage, upcoming appointments.
AI-Generated Treatment Reports:
Viewable & downloadable in PDF format.
Role-Specific UI:
Admins get access to billing & analytics.
Dentists get treatment planning tools.
✅ Tech Stack for UI:

React.js + Tailwind CSS for fast, responsive UI.
ShadCN UI components for a polished look.
Framer Motion for smooth animations.
5. Payment & Subscription Management (Demo)
Basic pricing tiers: Free trial (5 scans) → Upgrade to Basic/Pro.
Demo Mode: Auto-generate dummy invoices to simulate payments.
✅ Stripe API for Future Integration

Set up dummy payment options (not fully functional in MVP).
Technical Architecture
Frontend:
