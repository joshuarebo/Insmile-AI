Develop a fully functional MVP for Insmile AI, focusing on core features without AI processing. Ensure that clinics can onboard, manage patients, upload treatment files, track treatment progress, and handle subscription-based pricing models. Maintain a clean and user-friendly UI with smooth navigation."

üîπ Core Functionalities to Implement
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Authentication & Role-Based Access
Enable clinic registration & login with JWT authentication.
Implement role-based access control:
Admin: Manage users, billing, and clinic-wide settings.
Dentist: Upload treatment files, create treatment plans, and track progress.
Clinic Staff: View patient records and assist with scheduling.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Patient & Treatment Plan Management
Implement secure patient records, stored in PostgreSQL or Firebase.
Assign each patient a unique identifier (UPI) for tracking.
Enable manual treatment plan creation (diagnosis, procedures, medications).
Allow file uploads (JPEG, PNG, PDF, DICOM) for patient scans & treatment notes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Subscription-Based Pricing Model
Implement a tiered subscription model for clinics:
Plan	Monthly Fee (KES)	Features	Ideal For
Basic	KES 75,000	Patient management, file uploads	Small clinics (<100 patients/month)
Pro	KES 150,000	Treatment planning, basic workflow tools	Mid-sized clinics (100-500 patients/month)
Enterprise	KES 250,000	Full automation, API access	Large hospitals, chains (>500 patients/month)
Enable subscription upgrades, renewals & billing tracking.
Integrate M-Pesa, Stripe & PayPal for payments.
4Ô∏è‚É£ File Upload & Secure Storage
Drag-and-drop file upload system with preview.
Storage in Azure Blob Storage for scalability.
Allow renaming, deleting, and downloading files.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Modern UI/UX & Dashboard Enhancements
React.js + Tailwind CSS for a smooth, intuitive experience.
Sidebar navigation for Dashboard, Patients, Treatments, Billing.
Dark mode & mobile-friendly design.
üìå Final Deliverables
‚úÖ Clinic & patient management system.
‚úÖ Secure file upload & storage system.
‚úÖ Subscription-based pricing model with billing.
‚úÖ Modern UI/UX with smooth navigation.
‚úÖ Scalable architecture for future AI integration.

üìå Paste This in Replit AI for Development
**"Build an MVP for Insmile AI that includes user authentication (Admin, Dentist, Staff) with JWT. Enable clinics to register, manage patients, and create treatment plans. Develop a secure file upload system with Azure Blob Storage for scans (JPEG, PNG, PDF, DICOM).

Implement a subscription model with three tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) and integrate M-Pesa, Stripe, and PayPal for payments. Provide an admin dashboard to track billing and subscriptions.

Use React.js + Tailwind CSS for a clean UI with sidebar navigation (Dashboard, Patients, Treatments, Billing). Ensure performance optimization with database caching and JWT-based security. Make the system scalable for future AI features."**
